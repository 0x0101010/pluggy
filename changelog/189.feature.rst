``PluginManager.load_setuptools_entrypoints`` now accepts a ``name`` parameter that when given will
load only entry points with that name.

``PluginManager.load_setuptools_entrypoints`` also now returns the number of plugins loaded by the
call, as opposed to the number of all plugins loaded by all calls to this method.
